# **HOW THE CODE WORKS**
the programme keeps track of the items and the quantity in stock 

## lets say for example
A store has new stock of all items and they are all kept at a quantity of 100 each, the system will update the values to this.
when items are being purchased the quantity is being deducted

## parameters
there are two options here:
1. within the store the client can enter the item name and it says availble or unavailable, but not the quantity
2. the employee however enters the item and the quantity appears, this is made possible by the prompt that asks if the user is a client or an employee, if an employee the stored password hs to be entered.

### at the end of the day the following is printed out
1. new quantity of stock is printed out and written to the out put file 
2. total made for the day is also shown from the sales made
3. employees who logged a search are shown
3. the items search and the amounts of times they were searched is also shown.


#### in this project the database will just be an input file
#### the data written back to the database will just be written back as a file(receipt)
